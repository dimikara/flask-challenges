This repo contains some simple webapp ideas for flask beginners to practice. Each project has the requirements in a README file and a folder with the solution. Try to implement it on your own before looking at the solution. It is very important to try so you can have a glimpse of how developers solve problems in the real world. The challenges are listed from the easiest to the hardest one.

## [Challenge 1 - Personal Page](challenge-01)

You'll create a personal page with some routes so you can get an idea of how flask works.

## [Challenge 2 - Your First Api](challenge-2)

## [Challenge 3 - Rendering Data From Your Api](challenge-03)
