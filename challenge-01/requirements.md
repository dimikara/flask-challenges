# Personal Page

## Requirements

1. The page must have three routes:

   - Home
   - About
   - Projects

2. Home - here, you have to create a brief paragraph to describe the page and a list with links for the other pages.

3. About - in this page, you can tell whatever you want about yourself (it doesn't have to be true)

4. Projects - list in this page the projects you're working on or the ones you'd like to create.

## Solution

Try as much as you can to develop this by yourself. Go to [flask docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) if you need more information. After researching for some reasonable amount of time, if you still feel lost, take a look at the solution and try again.

## Tips

- You don't need to add any style
- Create a link in the about and projects pages so you can return to the home page
